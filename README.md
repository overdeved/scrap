Welcome to Scanner!

Scanner is a Django application designed to fetch and extract data from Allegro.pl, a popular e-commerce platform. Leveraging the capabilities of requests and Beautiful Soup, Scanner offers a seamless data extraction experience, empowering users to gather valuable insights effortlessly.

The core engine of the app is located in the `core_apps/scanner.py` file, which is imported into the `views.py` file so that it can be rendered in a web browser when the Django server is running.
